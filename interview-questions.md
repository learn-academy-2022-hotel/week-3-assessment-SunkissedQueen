# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

SUGGESTION TO ADD MORE CONTENT: provide examples, share experience using the tool, share something new that you learned from research

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?
From Developer Molly
Your answer:

Researched answer: JSX means JavaScript Syntax Extention. It is an extension of JavaScrpit that allow us to write HTML within JavaScript. It is a combination of JavaScript and HTML. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX, is that in JSX we must return a single parent element and in HTML we don't. In JSX, it is possible to write JavaScript directly by using curly braces. In HTML, we need a script tag.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?
From Developer Monica
Your answer:

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager that allows us to share code with other developers in order to avoid rewriting components, libraries and frameworks. In order for our code to work properly yarn ensures this by yarning in all of the dependencies needed. Once Yarn is run it updates the yarn.lock file. This file is the foundation of the current project and by updating it makes it fast and reliable.

3. What is a React component?
From Developer Moss
Your answer: A React component is a snippet of code that is reusable and has functionality. There are class components and function components, each of which work similarly to JavaScript functions.
Researched answer: Components in React are bits of code that are independent from other code and can be reused. They function similarly to JavaScript functions, however a component is isolated and often returns HTML when called upon to be visible on a page.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?
From Developer Natally
Your answer:
State is a variable that stores data and determines how that data gets rendered and how it behaves. Props on the other hand, allow you to access that data and pass it from one component to the other.
Researched answer:
The difference between state and props in React, is that state is an entity with some details that can alter during the components lifetime.State is an updated structure that is used to contain, and can modify data or that specific information about the component over time. On the contrary, props (short for properties) allow you to customize your components. It allows you to re-use a component by passing properties into it.
An analogy that has helped me understand this concept better, is that state is the heart of our application. It stores our data and later pumps that information to our components for rendering, giving our app life.Props on the other hand, are the blood, they pass the necessary data to our components.

5. What is the DOM?
From Developer Ney
Your answer:

Researched answer: Document Object Model, a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document content, style, and structure.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?
From Developer Oscar
Your answer: Div and span are similar in the fact that they are containers to help organize parts of code or webpages. Span elements are beneficial for styling and inline coding
Researched answer: Divs are utilized to create seperations in form of blocks. It's often used in multiple paragraph articles separated by div blocks. Divs make it easier to identify sections of a webpage. Spans are used on lines of code to apply styling. They do not start on new lines and only take up as much space as their content.
